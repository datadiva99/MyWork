PROBLEM	DEFINITION
Build	a	model to	predict	the	quality	of red wine using	its	attributes..	
This	is	an	informally	defined	ptoblem.	First	formally	define	this	problem	and	then	
build	a	model	and	report	your findings.
DATA
The	dataset is related	to	white	Portuguese	"Vinho	Verde"	wine.	For	more	info	go:	
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality
TASK	
1. (10	points)	Import	the	data	to	R	(no	cleanup	necessary).		
2. (10 points)	Check	data	characteristics.	Is	there	missing	data?	What	is	the	
correlation?
3. (30	points)	Propose	a	model	for	the	prediction.	Give	a	few	reasons	for	
your	selection	briefly.	You	may	choose	to	model	the	problem	as	
classification	or	regression.	 Define	the	task,	experience	and	performance	
criteria.
4. (30	points)	Do	10	fold	cross	validation	in	the	experiment.
5. (20	points)	Report	your	results.		
6. (Bonus	20	points) Other	researchers	have	built	predictive	models	using	
this	data.	Do	a brief	comparison of	your	results with	the	result	in	the	
following	paper:

OUTPUT
A	zip	file	containing	the	following
• A	report	with:
o Model
o Results
o Brief	discussion	of	the	work	done	for	each	task
• All	the	source	code
