Question 1

a = load '/user/lab/pig/full_text.txt' AS (id:chararray, ts:chararray, location:chararray, lat:float, lon:float, tweet:chararray);
b = foreach a generate ToDate(ts) as ts1, SUBSTRING(ts, 0, 10) as date, tweet as tweet;
c = foreach b generate date, GetHour(ts1) as hour, tweet;
d = FILTER c BY date MATCHES '2010-03-06';
e = GROUP d by hour;
f = FOREACH e GENERATE group as hour, COUNT (d) as cnt;
g = order f by cnt desc;
dump g;


Question 2

a = load '/user/lab/pig/full_text.txt' AS (id:chararray, ts:chararray, location:chararray, lat:float, lon:float, tweet:chararray);
b = foreach a generate id, TOTUPLE(lat, lon) as latlon:tuple(lat:chararray, lon:chararray);
c = distinct b;
d = group c by id;
e = foreach d generate group as id, COUNT(c) as cnt;
f = order e by cnt desc;
g = limit f 20;
dump g;


Questions 3

a = load '/user/lab/pig/full_text.txt' AS (id:chararray, ts:chararray, location:chararray, lat:float, lon:float, tweet:chararray);

c = foreach b generate REGEX_EXTRACT(tweet, '(.*)#(\\w+)(.*)',2) as tweet;
d = group c by tweet;
e = foreach d generate group as tweet, COUNT(c) as cnt;
f = order e by cnt desc;
g = limit f 10;
dump g;
