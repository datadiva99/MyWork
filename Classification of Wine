#Question 1
#I used the tools tab to import both datasets


#Question 2
#To check for missing I used the complete cases function for both datasets


winequality.red[!complete.cases(winequality.red),]
#or I could have used

complete.cases(winequality.white)
complete.cases(winequality.red)

#The output of both show that there are no missing values


#Change the format of the "quality" column to factor so it can be used as a label and not a numeric value
winequality.red[, "quality"] <- as.factor(winequality.red[, "quality"])
winequality.white[, "quality"] <- as.factor(winequality.white[, "quality"])
#A check to ensure the class was changed

class(winequality.red$quality)
class(winequality.white$quality)



#To check for correlations
cor(winequality.red[,1:11], method= c("pearson"))
cor(winequality.red[,1:11], method= c("spearman"))

#There were a few correlations so I check how strong the correlations were using
#pearson and spearman test
cor.test(winequality.red$fixed.acidity, winequality.red$alcohol, method= c("pearson"))
cor.test(winequality.red$fixed.acidity, winequality.red$citric.acid, method= c("spearman"))

#Since there are a few correclations, I will use stepwise regression to see 
#if those correlations have significance in my model

#Question 3
# I choose to model this problem as a classification issue.  The values of the dataset does not lend 
#itself to linear regression because the outcome variable "quality" is not continuous.  
#It only has 6 possible classes in which predications can be made to.

#Task- Classify the categories of quality of wine on a scale of 3 to 8
#based on 11 different variables

#Experience-Separate the winequality.red file into training and testing data using 10 fold cross validation
#
#Performance Criteria- TP Rate, FP Rate, Recall, Precision, Confusion matrix
#Compare results of Logistic regression and KNN

#I searched for the independent variables that might make the best prediction using
fit <- glm(quality~.,data=winequality.red,family=binomial())
summary(fit)


#next I added those variables into RWeka for logistic regression
weka_fit <- Logistic(quality~volatile.acidity+total.sulfur.dioxide, data = winequality.red)
evaluate_Weka_classifier(weka_fit, numFolds = 10, class = TRUE)

#I compared it to using all the variable of my datasets to see if I could improve performance
weka_fit <- Logistic(quality~., data = winequality.red)
evaluate_Weka_classifier(weka_fit, numFolds = 10, class = TRUE)

#The performance of the second model which included all of the variables was better than the 
#first that only used 2 variables
#Then I compared the performance of the Logistic regression to KNN


classifier <- IBk(quality ~., data = winequality.red,
                  control = Weka_control(K =20, X=TRUE))
evaluate_Weka_classifier(classifier, numFolds = 10, class = TRUE)

classifier

#KNN was a better predictor than logistic regression.
